# OCR Word search puzzle solver
 Creating a model that uses OCR to detect word search puzzles and solves them.
 (Using tesseract https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)


# Planning
* Input <br>
    Building and using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) model to derive a word search puzzle from an image.

* Solver <br>
    Creating an algorithm to scan the word search puzzle looking for the given words inside the puzzle.

* Remaining letters <br>
    Some word search puzzles contain a sentence or word within the remaining/unused letters in the puzzle.
    Another algorithm is needed to try and solve that list of randomised letters.


# Tasks
* Input
    * Get bounding boxes of the letters and process them
    * Turn the search puzzle into 2D array
    * Turn the given words into 1D array
    
* OCR
    * Use the images from the input and determine the letters.

* Solver
    * TODO
