# Word Search Solver
 Creating an algorithm to solve word search puzzles. (Using OCR as input)


# Planning
* Input
    Using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to derive a word search puzzle from either an image or a webcam video.

* Solver
    Creating an algorithm to scan the word search puzzle looking for the given words inside the puzzle.

* Remaining letters
    Some word search puzzles contain a sentence or word within the remaining/unused letters in the puzzle.
    Another algorithm is needed to try and solve that list of randomised letters.
