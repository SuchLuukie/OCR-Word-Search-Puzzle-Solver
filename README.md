# OCR Word search puzzle solver
 Creating an OCR model to create a word search puzzle solver.


# Planning
* Input <br>
    Building and using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to derive a word search puzzle from either an image or a webcam video.

* Solver <br>
    Creating an algorithm to scan the word search puzzle looking for the given words inside the puzzle.

* Remaining letters <br>
    Some word search puzzles contain a sentence or word within the remaining/unused letters in the puzzle.
    Another algorithm is needed to try and solve that list of randomised letters.


# Tasks
* OCR Model
    * Obtain dataset used to train the model (Using Kaggle A-Z dataset)
    * Split dataset in training and testing sets
    * Train and test the model

* Input
    * Get bounding boxes of the letters and process them
    * Turn the search puzzle into 2D array
    * Turn the given words into 1D array

* Solver
    * TODO
